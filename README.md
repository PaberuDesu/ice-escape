# ice-escape
 The game where each move creates ice on previous position cell. If there is a tail that contains 10 ice, the last one disappears. But not forever. If you or bot will step on that cell again and leave it, there would appear new ice, which color is more blue and this ice will not disappear. At start you have 10 points. Each time you next to undestructible ice you lose two and each time bot is next to this ice you get one point. Each level has tasks that you need to complete if you want to get stars on this level. But the main mission of level is to win. You can do this if you escape the room (doors open when your opponent can't move) or if bot is locked and will never get out. But you will lose if you lose all the points, if you would be locked forever or if bot will eat you
